        <p>This is a photo of Dan, or someone like him. It's actually Trent Lane, from the old skool MTV animated series Daria. Did you ever watch that show? I thought it was way ahead of it's time, but they tried to do a remake and it sort of sucks, now. Just doesn't really translate for a modern age, I guess.</p>
